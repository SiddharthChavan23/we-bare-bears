                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Three bear brothers do whatever they can to be a part of human society by doing what everyone around      them does.<br><br>

                Three brother bears awkwardly attempt to find their place in civilized society, whether they're looking for food, trying to make human friends, or scheming to become famous on the internet. Grizzly, Panda and Ice Bear stack atop one another when they leave their cave and explore the hipster environs of the San Francisco Bay Area, and it's clear the siblings have a lot to learn about a technologically driven world. By their side on many adventures are best friend Chloe (the only human character in the cast), fame-obsessed koala Nom Nom, and Charlie, aka Bigfoot.</p>

                        <figcaption>The nice thing about animations is that you can use anthropomorphic characters. Animals or objects can come alive and they can be a way for people to put themselves into a story regardless of race or something else specific.

                        <figcaption>We Bare Bears follows three anthropomorphic adoptive brother bears: Grizzly (often called Grizz), Panda (often called Pan-Pan), and Ice Bear. The bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.
